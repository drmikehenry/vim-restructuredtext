Inline delimiters:

   start *Testing delimiters* end

Escape character inside delimiter:

   start *This has\\a slash* end

Escape the delimiter:

   start *This has\*a delimiter* end

Delimiters with leading spaces do not act as delimiters:
[space][delim][non-space]...[non-space][delim][space]

   start *This delim * is not a delim*
   start *This delim *is also not a delim*

Double delimiters?

   start **This is a double delim** end

Escape a double delimiter?

   start **This is \** two delimiters inside a double delimiter** end

Escape slashes inside delimiters.

   This should render a single slash.

      start *C:\\* end

   This should raise an error due to an unclosed delimiter.

      start *C:\* end

   (Putting a delimiter here* to balance the syntax highlighting error.)
   
But there is an exception for the end of `` tokens:

   This renders a single slash and should not be escaped:

      start ``C:\`` end

   This renders two slashes:

      start ``C:\\`` end

The end
